# Simple Brain Tumor Detector

## Overview
This is my first machine learning project, focusing on detecting brain tumors from structured data. It uses a dataset from Kaggle to train a model for predicting the presence of a tumor.

## Dataset
- The project uses a CSV file containing patient data with various features.
- Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset includes indicators related to brain health and tumor presence.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand feature correlations.
- Applied logistic regression for tumor prediction.

## Tools Used
- Python for programming.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- RandomForest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- KNN
- SVM
- GaussianNB

## Learnings
This project taught me the basics of data science workflow, from data cleaning to model training and evaluation. It's a stepping stone towards more complex projects.
